# Legendary_Pokemon_Classification
For this project I'm using a Pokemon Dataset, which contains detailed information about Pokemons. The end goal here is to test Classifications Models and check if they can (accurately) classify a Pokemon as being Legendary/Non-Legendary based on their characteristics.
